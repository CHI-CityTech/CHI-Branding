## Background and Need
A strong visual identity builds organizational branding, fosters recognition, and effectively communicates values and goals. For the Center for Holistic Integration (CHI), this specific project serves as a foundational effort to establish a scalable and adaptable branding structure that will support future development. By laying the groundwork for consistent visual identities across CHI’s diverse meta-projects, this initiative ensures alignment with CHI’s core principles of integration, innovation, and collaboration. The key deliverable is not only the creation of individual logos and branding elements but also the establishment of a structured process that future artists and contributors can build upon, positioning CHI for sustainable growth and cohesive representation.

This project will play a critical role in advancing CHI’s efforts by creating a unified visual framework that enhances communication, professionalism, and outreach across all its meta-projects. A consistent branding system will strengthen CHI’s ability to attract collaborators, funding, and participants by presenting a clear and cohesive identity that reflects the organization’s values and goals. By connecting the different meta-projects into a unified branding system, this initiative will celebrate each project’s unique contributions while maintaining their alignment under the overarching CHI umbrella. The scalable branding elements and processes developed through this effort will ensure seamless integration of future projects while promoting CHI’s principles of innovation, integration, and collaboration. Additionally, the branding package will serve as a powerful tool for marketing, promotion, and engagement, helping CHI build stronger connections with internal teams, external partners, and broader audiences.

## Objective 

To extend the work initiated with the **Anti-Hate logo and recursive fish design** into a unified branding system for the **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)** and its associated meta-projects. This system will include unique logos for each meta-project, along with a comprehensive branding package that outlines their relationship to the core CHI logo. The package will also define a set of rules for generating additional meta-project logos and brands, ensuring scalability as CHI continues to grow.  

Deliverables will include a **style book**, similar in purpose to [City Tech’s branding guide](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/citytechbranding/CityTechIDbook.pdf), that details fonts, color palettes, logo usage, and rules for designing future logos to maintain a cohesive identity.  

A full list of CHI’s meta-projects requiring logos and branding can be found [here]. These meta-projects represent diverse disciplines and goals, and the branding system must capture their individuality while maintaining a cohesive connection to CHI’s overarching mission.

## 1. Introduction and Vision  

As the designer behind the **Anti-Hate logo**, you have already established a foundation for CHI’s visual identity, leveraging the **recursive fish design** inspired by CHI’s Tao-based core logo. This proposal invites you to expand on that work by creating a series of logos and branding materials for CHI and its meta-projects.  

The resulting system will combine **recursive Tao motifs**, **Escher-like tessellations**, and other visual elements to create an interconnected identity that reflects CHI’s principles of balance, integration, and creativity. Each meta-project’s branding will be tailored to its unique focus while remaining visually connected to CHI’s identity.

</div>

### 2.1 Foundational Elements  
- **Core CHI Logo**: The Tao-inspired CHI logo will remain the centerpiece of the branding system.  
- **Anti-Hate Recursive Fish Design**: This logo will serve as a conceptual and stylistic foundation for the other meta-projects, extending its recursive and fractal themes into other logo designs. Additional exploration to more fully embrace the forground/background ambiguity of Escher is required (as one can see from teh image above, there are two fish in the foreground and also a background: in the Tao there is a forground/background ambiguity.
- **Escher-Like Tessellations**: Create interlocking shapes and patterns for use in logos and supporting visuals, emphasizing connection and balance.  

### 2.2 Meta-Project Logos  
Each meta-project will have a custom logo inspired by the core CHI design and reflecting its individual themes. These logos will be developed for the following meta-projects (see the [full list here](https://chi-citytech.github.io/Meta-Project.html):  
1. **Balanced Blended Space (BBS):**  
   - A quadrant or interlocking design representing the blending of physical and virtual spaces.  
2. **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP):**  
   - Interlocking puppets inspired by shadow play, with light and shadow elements.  
3. **Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS):**  
   - Modular, fractal forms symbolizing integration of real and virtual components.  
4. **Collaborative AI:**  
   - Neural and fractal patterns highlighting recursion and adaptability.  
5. **World Building:**  
   - Expanding worlds or orbits symbolizing narrative creation and cultural research.  
6. **Game Development:**  
   - Designs reflecting specific games like **Shadow Sports** or **Lumbra**, incorporating dynamic light and shadow patterns.  
7. **Educational and Outreach Initiatives:**  
   - A logo reflecting cross-cultural connections, teaching, and learning.  

### 2.3 Style Book and Branding Package  
The branding package will provide guidelines for consistency and scalability, including:  
- **Logo Relationships:** How each meta-project logo connects visually to the core CHI logo.  
- **Rules for Additional Logos:** A systematic approach to creating new logos for future meta-projects, ensuring they align with CHI’s visual identity while allowing for individuality.  
- **Style Guide:** Fonts, color palettes, logo usage, and design principles.  
- **Stationery Design:** Letterheads, business cards, and other materials for CHI and its meta-projects.  
- **Digital Assets:** Templates for social media, websites, and presentations.  
- **Patterns and Motifs:** A library of Escher-like tessellations and recursive designs for use in supporting materials.

## 7. Conclusion  

This proposal builds on your existing work with the Anti-Hate logo, extending its principles to create a unified and adaptable branding system for CHI. By incorporating recursive Tao motifs, Escher-like tessellations, and meta-project-specific designs, this initiative will provide CHI with a professional and scalable visual identity. The comprehensive branding package, including rules for future logo generation, ensures that CHI’s identity remains cohesive and adaptable as it evolves.
